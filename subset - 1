Problem Statement

Lucy has a set of integers, and she is interested in finding out how many subsets from this set sum up to a specific target number. The program should efficiently calculate the number of subsets that sum up to a given target sum. Additionally, after finding the count of subsets, a small mathematical operation is performed on the result:

If the count of subsets is even, it should be multiplied by 3.
If the count is odd, 7 should be added to the count.


Your task is to help Lucy implement the solution and perform the required operation on the result.



Example:

Input

4

1 3 5 2

6

Output

2

Explanation:

Subset1= {1,5}, Subset2= {1,3,2}. 1+5 = 6, 1+3+2 = 6. 

The obtained result is even, so multiply it by 3 (2 * 3 = 6)

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a single integer n, representing the number of elements in the set.

The second line consists of an integer, representing the elements of the set. These integers are space-separated.

The third line consists of a single integer, representing the target sum for which the subsets need to sum up.

Output format :
The first line of output prints a single integer that represents the number of subsets whose sum equals the target sum.

The second line prints the result after performing the operation based on whether the subset count is even or odd.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the given test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ elements of the set ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
